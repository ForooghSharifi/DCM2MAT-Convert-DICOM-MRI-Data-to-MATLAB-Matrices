# DCM2MAT-Convert-DICOM-MRI-Data-to-MATLAB-Matrices
This MATLAB function, DCM2MAT.m, is designed to process MRI data from rodents in a stroke study. It converts MRI images, Region of Interest (ROI) masks, and lesion boundaries into MATLAB matrices. The dataset originates from the Zenodo repository: "Dataset on Infarct Volume in Rodents: A Comparison of MRI and Histological Methods (Version v2)."
